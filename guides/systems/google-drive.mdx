## Google Drive Types

### Understanding the Difference

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="My Drive (Personal)">
    **Individual Storage:**

    - **Personal files** you own
    - **Your responsibility** to manage
    - Share individual files/folders with others
    - If you leave SAS, **files go with you** or are deleted
    - Good for: Personal documents, individual projects

    **Use for:**
    - Draft documents
    - Personal work
    - Files you don't need to share permanently
    - Temporary projects

    <Warning>
      **Limitation:** If you leave SAS, files in My Drive are deleted after 30 days or transferred to you.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Shared Drives (RECOMMENDED)">
    **Team/Department Storage:**

    - **Owned by the organization**, not individuals
    - **Persistent** - files stay even when members leave
    - **Team collaboration** - everyone has access
    - **Department drives** for each team/subject/grade
    - **Automatic permissions** based on membership

    **Use for:**
    - ✅ Department documents
    - ✅ Team projects
    - ✅ Curriculum materials
    - ✅ Shared resources
    - ✅ Collaborative work
    - ✅ Any file that multiple people need

    <Tip>
      **Best Practice:** Store ALL work-related files in Shared Drives, not My Drive!
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Shared with Me">
    **Files Others Share:**

    - Files/folders shared with you by others
    - **Not stored in your Drive** - just shortcuts
    - Owner controls access and can remove
    - Can copy to your Drive if needed

    **Note:** This is just a view - the actual files live in someone else's Drive or Shared Drive.

    - **Files persist** even when people leave
    - **Everyone sees the same** folder structure
    - **Permissions are automatic** based on team membership

    **Examples at SAS:**
    - **Grade 5 Team Drive** - All Grade 5 teachers
    - **Finance Department Drive** - Finance staff
    - **Science Department Drive** - Science teachers
    - **Facilities Drive** - Facilities team
    - **Elementary Principal Drive** - Admin team
