JAMF is the **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** system that manages all SAS school devices. It ensures your iPad or MacBook has the right apps, settings, and security configurations automatically.

<Note>
  **All SAS school devices** (iPads and MacBooks) are managed through JAMF to provide a secure, consistent experience.

## How JAMF Works

### Automatic Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Device Enrollment">
    When you receive a new SAS device, it's already enrolled in JAMF with your account information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Profile Installation">
    JAMF automatically installs configuration profiles for WiFi, email, security, and settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="App Deployment">
    Required apps for your grade level and classes are automatically downloaded and installed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Updates & Maintenance">
    JAMF keeps your device updated with the latest apps, security patches, and configurations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Behind the Scenes**: JAMF works quietly in the background. You won't see it running, but it ensures everything works smoothly!
