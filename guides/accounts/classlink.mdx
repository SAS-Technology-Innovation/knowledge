### Teacher Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Using My Classes Effectively:**

  ✅ **Assign apps before unit starts** - Give students access in advance

  ✅ **Review engagement weekly** - Check analytics to ensure all students have access

  ✅ **Organize by subject** - Keep class-specific apps in My Classes, school-wide apps in main LaunchPad

  ✅ **Communicate app expectations** - Tell students which apps they should see and use
