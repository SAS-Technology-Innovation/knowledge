## SAS AI Use Policy

### General Guidelines

<Info>
  **SAS AI Use Principles:**

  1. **Transparency is Required**
     - Always disclose when you use AI
     - Cite AI assistance appropriately
     - Be honest with teachers about your process

  2. **Learning Comes First**
     - Use AI to understand, not to bypass learning
     - You must be able to explain your work
     - Focus on developing skills, not just completing tasks

  3. **Follow Teacher Instructions**
     - Each teacher may have specific policies
     - Assignment instructions take precedence
     - When in doubt, ask first

  4. **Division-Appropriate Tools**
     - High School: Google Gemini
     - Middle School: Magic School AI
     - Elementary: Toddle AI
     - Use your division's official tool

  5. **Zero Tolerance for Academic Dishonesty**
     - Submitting AI work as entirely your own is plagiarism
     - Violations result in serious consequences
     - Repeat offenses escalate penalties
</Info>

## How to Use AI Without Cheating

### The 3-Step Framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Permission">
    **Before using AI for any assignment:**

    1. Read assignment instructions carefully
    2. Check for AI use policies or restrictions
    3. Ask your teacher if unclear
    4. Review your class syllabus for AI guidelines

    **Questions to Ask:**
    - "Is AI allowed for this assignment?"
    - "Can I use AI for brainstorming/editing/research?"
    - "How should I cite AI assistance?"
    - "What level of AI use is appropriate?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use AI Responsibly">
    **When AI is allowed:**

    **DO:**
    - Use AI as a learning tool
    - Ask AI to explain concepts
    - Have AI generate practice materials
    - Use AI to check your work
    - Keep your own thinking central

    **DON'T:**
    - Let AI do the work for you
    - Copy AI output without understanding
    - Use AI to bypass learning
    - Submit AI work as entirely yours
    - Hide AI involvement

    **The 70-30 Rule:**
    At least 70% should be YOUR thinking, work, and voice.
    At most 30% should be AI assistance (brainstorming, editing, checking).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document and Cite">
    **Always be transparent:**

    **What to Document:**
    - Which AI tool you used
    - When you used it
    - How you used it (brainstorming, editing, etc.)
    - What AI contributed vs. what's yours

    **How to Cite:**
    See [Citation Examples](/guides/ai-resources/gemini-guide#citing-gemini-in-your-work) or ask your teacher for the required format.

    **Minimum Documentation:**
    ```
    AI Tool Used: Google Gemini
    Date: October 13, 2024
    Purpose: I used Gemini to brainstorm essay topics and
    to check grammar in my final draft.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
