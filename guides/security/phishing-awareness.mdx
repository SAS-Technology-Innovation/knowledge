## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of cyberattack where criminals impersonate legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.

<Warning>
  **Phishing is the #1 cause of security breaches** at schools and organizations worldwide. Learning to spot phishing attempts is one of the most important security skills you can develop.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **The Eagle Way** - We protect our community by staying alert and informed. If something seems suspicious, it probably is. Trust your instincts and verify before you click.
</Note>

</Card>

**Example:**
```
From: IT-Support@sas-edu-sg.com ‚ö†Ô∏è (fake domain)
Subject: URGENT: Your account will be suspended

Your SAS email account will be closed in 24 hours due to
suspicious activity. Click here to verify your account immediately:

    - "Hello,"

    ‚úÖ **Legitimate:**

    1. **Hover over the link** (don't click!)
       - On computer: Hover mouse to see URL

       ‚ùå sas.edu.sg.verify-account.com (extra subdomain)

    - .jpg or .png

    **Before opening ANY attachment:**
    1. Do you know the sender?

    4. Is the file name suspicious? (Invoice_039485.exe)
  </Accordion>
