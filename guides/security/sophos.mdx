## What is Sophos?

Sophos is the **endpoint security software** that protects all SAS devices from viruses, malware, and cyber threats. It runs quietly in the background, keeping your device and data safe.

<Note>
  **All SAS school devices** have Sophos installed automatically to provide comprehensive security protection.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reporting">
    Serious threats are reported to IT for investigation and response.
