## What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), adds an extra layer of security to your SAS account. Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without the second factor.

<Note>
  **The Eagle Way** - MFA is one of the most effective ways to protect your digital identity. Taking a few minutes to set it up can prevent unauthorized access and keep our school community secure.

### Real-World Example

<Accordion title="How MFA Stopped an Attack" icon="shield-check">
  **Scenario:** A student receives a convincing phishing email that looks like it's from SAS IT. They click the link and enter their password on a fake login page.

  **Without MFA:** ❌ The attacker immediately gains access to:
  - Student email
  - ClassLink apps
  - Google Workspace documents
  - Personal and academic information

  **With MFA:** ✅ The attacker has the password but:
  - Can't complete the login without the MFA code
  - Student receives an unexpected MFA request and realizes the compromise
  - Student changes password before any damage is done
  - Account remains secure

  **Result:** MFA prevented a potential data breach and identity theft!

## Authentication Methods

### Recommended Methods (Most Secure)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticator App (BEST)" icon="mobile-screen-button">
    **Most secure and convenient option**

    **Popular Authenticator Apps:**
    - **Microsoft Authenticator** (recommended for SAS)
    - Google Authenticator
    - Authy
    - 1Password
    - Duo Mobile

    **Pros:**
    - Works without internet connection
    - Quick and easy to use
    - More secure than SMS
    - Can back up codes (some apps)

    **Cons:**
    - Requires smartphone
    - Need to set up initially
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hardware Security Key" icon="usb-drive">
    **Highest security level**

    **Examples:**
    - YubiKey
    - Google Titan Security Key

    **Pros:**
    - Most secure method
    - No battery or internet needed
    - Resistant to phishing

    **Cons:**
    - Costs money ($25-$50)
    - Can be lost or forgotten
    - Requires USB/NFC support
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push Notifications" icon="bell">
    **Easy and user-friendly**

    **How it works:**
    - Receive push notification on trusted device
    - Approve or deny login attempt

    **Pros:**
    - Very convenient
    - No codes to type
    - Clear login context

    **Cons:**
    - Requires internet connection
    - Depends on app/service support
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backup Methods (Less Secure)

<Warning>
  **Use these only as backup options, not primary methods:**

  **SMS Text Message:**
  - ⚠️ Vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks
  - ⚠️ Requires cell signal
  - ✅ Better than no MFA
  - ✅ Widely supported

  **Email Verification:**
  - ⚠️ Only as secure as your email account
  - ⚠️ Creates circular dependency if email is compromised
  - ✅ Works on any device with email access

  **Voice Call:**
  - ⚠️ Can be intercepted
  - ⚠️ Less convenient
  - ✅ Works on landlines
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Security Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Authenticator App as Primary">
    Authenticator apps are more secure than SMS. Use SMS only as backup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Cloud Backup">
    In Microsoft Authenticator or Authy, enable cloud backup so you don't lose access if your phone breaks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Recovery Codes Securely">
    Save recovery codes in:
    - Password manager (1Password, LastPass)
    - Encrypted USB drive
    - Secure physical location (safe, lockbox)

    **Never:** Email them to yourself or save in unencrypted notes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Multiple Backup Methods">
    Configure at least 2-3 authentication methods:
    - Primary: Authenticator app
    - Backup 1: SMS to mobile
    - Backup 2: Recovery codes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Don't Share MFA Codes">
    Never give your MFA code to anyone, even if they claim to be from IT. IT will never ask for your MFA code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Trusted Devices Regularly">
    Periodically check and remove trusted devices you no longer use:
    - Go to security settings
    - Review list of trusted devices
    - Remove old or unknown devices
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What to Do When...

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Getting a New Phone" icon="mobile" color="#1A4190">
    **Before switching:**
    1. Set up authenticator app on new phone
    2. Verify it works
    3. Then remove old phone from account

    **Or:** Use cloud backup to restore on new device
  </Card>

  <Card title="Traveling Abroad" icon="plane" color="#E51322">

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is MFA required at SAS?" icon="question">
    **For Faculty & Staff:** Yes, MFA is required on all SAS accounts for security compliance.

    **For Students:** MFA may be required for certain grade levels and systems. Check with your division for specific requirements.

    **For Parents:** MFA is optional but highly recommended for PowerSchool, Veracross, and other parent portals.

    Even if not required, **we strongly recommend** enabling MFA for all accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which authenticator app should I use?" icon="mobile-screen-button">
    **Recommended (in order):**
    1. **Microsoft Authenticator** - Works seamlessly with SAS systems, has cloud backup, supports multiple accounts
    2. **Google Authenticator** - Simple and reliable, but no cloud backup
    3. **Authy** - Good alternative with cloud backup and multi-device support
    4. **1Password** - If you already use 1Password for password management

    **All of these are free and work well.** Choose whichever you're most comfortable with.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the same authenticator app for personal accounts?" icon="user">
    **Yes!** Authenticator apps can manage multiple accounts:
    - SAS accounts
    - Personal email
    - Social media
    - Banking apps
    - Any service that supports MFA

    This is actually convenient - one app for all your MFA codes!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't have a smartphone?" icon="phone-slash">
    **Alternative Options:**
    1. **Hardware security key** - YubiKey or similar USB device
    2. **SMS to basic phone** - If your phone can receive texts
    3. **Printed recovery codes** - Keep in secure location
    4. **Alternative device** - iPad or Android tablet with authenticator app

    Contact IT Support to discuss which option works best for your situation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does MFA slow down my login?" icon="clock">
    **Initial setup:** Takes 5-10 minutes once

    **Daily use:** Adds about 5-10 seconds per login

    **After marking devices as trusted:** Minimal additional time on your regular devices

    **The tradeoff:** A few seconds for significantly better security is worth it!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I turn off MFA?" icon="toggle-off">
    **For required accounts (staff):** No, MFA is mandatory for security compliance.

    **For optional accounts:** Yes, but **we strongly discourage this**. MFA is one of the best protections against account compromise.

    **If you must disable it:** Go to security settings and remove authentication methods, but understand you're putting your account at risk.
