<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Length" icon="ruler">
    Minimum **12 characters** (longer is better)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complexity" icon="key">
    Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
  </Card>

    Different from previous passwords
  </Card>

  <Card title="Personal Info" icon="user-slash">
    Don't use your name, birthday, or obvious words
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Password Strength Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="❌ Weak Passwords (Never Use These)" icon="xmark">
    - `Password123` - Too common and predictable
    - `SAS2024` - Contains obvious school reference
    - `Birthday1234` - Uses personal information
    - `qwerty` - Keyboard pattern
    - `johnsmith` - Your name
    - Any password you've used elsewhere
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Strong Passwords (Good Examples)" icon="check">
    - `Tr0pic@l-Mang0-S!ngap0re` - Long, mixed characters, memorable phrase
    - `BlueDragon$Flies#2024!` - Random words with symbols and numbers
    - `C0ffee&Books*Library99` - Personal interests with modifications
    - `Hawker!Center$Laksa#88` - Local reference with complexity

    **Tip:** Use a passphrase (sentence) with character substitutions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Password Best Practices

### DO's ✅

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use a Password Manager">
    Store passwords securely in a password manager like:
    - **1Password** (recommended for SAS staff)
    - **LastPass**
    - **Bitwarden**
    - Built-in browser password managers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Unique Passwords">
    Use a different password for every account. If one is compromised, others remain safe.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make It Long and Complex">
    12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Passphrases">
    String together random words with symbols: `Green$Elephant!Dances#Moon`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Multi-Factor Authentication">
    Add an extra layer of security beyond just your password. [Learn about MFA](/guides/security/multi-factor-authentication)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### DON'Ts ❌

<Warning>
  **Never do these things with your password:**

  - Share your password with anyone (even friends or family)
  - Write passwords on sticky notes or in unsecured documents
  - Use the same password across multiple accounts
  - Include personal information (name, birthday, phone number)
  - Save passwords in plain text files
  - Send passwords via email or text message
  - Use simple dictionary words or common phrases
  - Reuse old passwords
</Warning>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often should I change my password?" icon="calendar">
    **Current SAS Policy:** You should change your password:
    - Every 90 days (if required by policy)
    - Immediately if you suspect compromise
    - When you receive a security alert
    - After sharing it accidentally

    **Best Practice:** Use a strong, unique password with MFA enabled. With MFA, frequent password changes are less critical than password strength and uniqueness.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the same password for my SAS and personal accounts?" icon="question">
    **No, never reuse passwords.** If your personal account is compromised in a data breach, attackers will try that password on other services including school accounts. Always use unique passwords for each account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it safe to save passwords in my browser?" icon="browser">
    **Generally yes, but with caveats:**

    Modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox) use encryption to store passwords. However:
    - Enable a master password/device lock
    - Don't use browser passwords on shared computers
    - Consider a dedicated password manager for additional features
    - Keep your browser updated
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I forgot my password and can't reset it?" icon="lock-open">
    Contact the appropriate support team:

    **Students:** EdTech Support
    - Email: [edtech@sas.edu.sg](mailto:edtech@sas.edu.sg)

    - Email: [communityambassadors@sas.edu.sg](mailto:communityambassadors@sas.edu.sg)
    - Phone: +65 6363 3403
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use a password manager?" icon="vault">
    **Yes, highly recommended!** Password managers:
    - Generate strong, unique passwords for each account
    - Securely store and encrypt your passwords
    - Auto-fill passwords on websites and apps
    - Sync across your devices
    - Alert you to compromised passwords

    **Recommended options:**
