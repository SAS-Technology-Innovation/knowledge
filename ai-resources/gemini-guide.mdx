## How to Use Gemini Effectively

### Writing Great Prompts

The quality of Gemini's responses depends on how you ask questions. Here's how to write effective prompts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific and Clear">
    **Instead of:**
    > "Tell me about photosynthesis"

    **Try:**
    > "Explain photosynthesis to a 9th grade biology student in 3 main steps, including the role of chlorophyll"

    **Why it's better:**
    - Specifies the audience level
    - Asks for structured format (3 steps)
    - Includes specific details needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Context">
    **Instead of:**
    > "Help me write an essay"

    **Try:**
    > "I'm writing a 5-paragraph persuasive essay for 11th grade English about renewable energy. My thesis is that Singapore should invest more in solar power. Can you help me brainstorm 3 strong supporting arguments?"

    **Why it's better:**
    - States the assignment type
    - Specifies grade level
    - Shares the thesis
    - Defines what help is needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask for Specific Formats">
    **Examples:**
    - "Create a table comparing..."
    - "List 5 bullet points about..."
    - "Explain using an analogy..."
    - "Summarize in 100 words..."
    - "Generate 10 practice questions..."

    **Benefits:**
    - Get responses in the format you need
    - Easier to use in your work
    - More organized information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate and Refine">
    **Start Broad:**
    > "What are the main causes of climate change?"

    **Then Get Specific:**
    > "Can you explain the greenhouse effect in more detail?"

    **Further Refine:**
    > "Give me an analogy to help understand how greenhouse gases trap heat"

    **Benefits:**
    - Build on previous responses
    - Clarify confusing points
    - Dive deeper into topics
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Constraints and Requirements">
    **Examples:**
    - "Using only information from 2020-2024..."
    - "Appropriate for 8th grade reading level..."
    - "In 200 words or less..."
    - "Without using technical jargon..."
    - "Focus only on social impacts, not economic..."

    **Benefits:**
    - Get more relevant responses
    - Match assignment requirements
    - Stay within scope
  </Step>
</Steps>
