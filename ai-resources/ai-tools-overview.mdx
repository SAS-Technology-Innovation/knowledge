## How AI Tools Work

### Understanding AI Basics

<Accordion title="What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?" icon="brain">
  AI tools like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude are based on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** - AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like responses.

  **Key Points:**

  - AI predicts the most likely next words based on patterns in training data
  - AI doesn't "know" things like humans - it recognizes patterns
  - Responses are generated, not retrieved from a database
  - AI can make mistakes (called "hallucinations")
  - Quality of output depends on quality of your input (prompts)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to Get Better Results (Prompt Engineering)" icon="message">
  **Effective Prompting:**

  1. **Be Specific**
     - ❌ "Tell me about history"
     - ✅ "Explain the causes of World War II in 3 main points"
  2. **Provide Context**
     - ❌ "Help with my essay"
     - ✅ "I'm writing a 5-paragraph persuasive essay for 10th grade English about renewable energy. Can you help me brainstorm three supporting arguments?"
  3. **Ask for Format**
     - "Explain this in bullet points"
     - "Create a table comparing..."
     - "Write this for a middle school audience"
  4. **Iterate and Refine**
     - Start broad, then get specific
     - Ask follow-up questions
     - Request clarification or examples
  5. **Set Constraints**
     - "In 100 words or less..."
     - "Using only sources from 2020-2024..."
     - "Appropriate for grade 8 reading level..."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What AI Can and Cannot Do" icon="scale-balanced">
  **AI Can:** ✅ Explain complex concepts in simpler terms ✅ Generate ideas and brainstorm ✅ Provide examples and analogies ✅ Help organize thoughts and outlines ✅ Draft and edit text ✅ Translate languages ✅ Summarize long documents ✅ Answer questions based on training data

  **AI Cannot:** ❌ Think creatively like humans ❌ Understand context like people ❌ Access real-time information (unless explicitly enabled) ❌ Guarantee accuracy (can produce false information) ❌ Replace critical thinking and learning ❌ Understand emotions and nuance perfectly ❌ Make ethical decisions for you ❌ Access SAS-specific information unless provided
</Accordion>

    **Data Handling:**

    - NOT managed by SAS
    - Subject to external privacy policies
    - Data may be used for training
    - Limited SAS oversight

    **Use Caution When:**

    - Using for personal learning
    - Sharing any information
    - Working on sensitive topics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Age Restrictions

<Info>
  **Know the age requirements:**

  - **ChatGPT:** 13+ (Free), 18+ (Plus without parental consent)
  - **Claude:** 13+ (with parental consent)
