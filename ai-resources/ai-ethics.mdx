## Understanding AI Bias

### What is AI Bias?

**AI bias** occurs when AI systems produce unfair or prejudiced results. This happens because AI learns from data created by humans, which can contain human biases.

<Accordion title="Examples of AI Bias" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  **Real-World Examples:**

  1. **Gender Bias in Language:**
     - AI might associate certain professions with specific genders
     - Example: AI suggests "doctor = he" and "nurse = she"
     - **Impact:** Reinforces stereotypes

  2. **Cultural Bias in Images:**
     - AI image generators may default to Western/Caucasian representations
     - Example: "CEO" prompts generate mostly images of white men
     - **Impact:** Excludes diverse representation

  3. **Language Bias:**
     - AI trained primarily on English may perform worse in other languages
     - May not understand cultural contexts or idioms
     - **Impact:** Advantages English speakers

  4. **Historical Bias:**
     - AI trained on historical data reflects past inequalities
     - Example: Historical job data showing male-dominated fields
     - **Impact:** Perpetuates old patterns

  5. **Socioeconomic Bias:**
     - Training data may overrepresent certain economic classes
     - May not understand diverse lived experiences
     - **Impact:** Fails to serve all communities equally
</Accordion>

### How to Recognize and Address Bias

<Steps>
  <Step title="Question AI Outputs">
    **Ask yourself:**
    - Does this seem to favor one group over another?
    - Are diverse perspectives represented?
    - Would this answer be the same for people from different backgrounds?
    - Is this reinforcing stereotypes?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Seek Multiple Sources">
    **Don't rely solely on AI:**
    - Consult diverse human sources
    - Read perspectives from different cultures and backgrounds
    - Cross-reference AI information with authoritative sources
    - Talk to people with lived experience
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Context in Prompts">
    **Be specific about diversity:**
    - "Show me examples from diverse cultures"
    - "Include perspectives from multiple regions"
    - "Represent different genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds"
    - "Avoid stereotypes"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Report Problematic Outputs">
    **If AI produces biased content:**
    - Don't use it uncritically
    - Report to your teacher or EdTech
    - Discuss with classmates
    - Learn from the example
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Intellectual Property & Copyright

### Understanding AI and Copyright

<Accordion title="Who owns AI-generated content?" icon="copyright">
  **The Legal Gray Area:**

  AI-generated content exists in a complex legal space:

  1. **AI companies** (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic) claim some rights
  2. **Users** (you) may have rights to content you prompted
  3. **Original creators** whose work trained the AI have concerns
  4. **Legal standards** are still being determined

  **SAS Guideline:**
  - Assume AI content is NOT entirely yours
  - Always cite AI use
  - Transform AI suggestions with your own work
  - Don't claim AI work as original creation
</Accordion>

### Respecting Others' Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Don't Use AI to Plagiarize">
    **Wrong:**
    - Asking AI to rewrite someone else's article to avoid plagiarism detection
    - Using AI to paraphrase without citation
    - Having AI "change enough words" so it seems original

    **Right:**
    - Use AI to help you understand source material
    - Write in your own words based on your understanding
    - Always cite original sources, not just AI
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respect Classmates' Work">
    **Wrong:**
    - Sharing a classmate's essay with AI to "improve" it without permission
    - Using AI to copy someone's project idea
    - Uploading group work without team consent

    **Right:**
    - Only share your own work with AI
    - Get permission before involving AI in collaborative work
    - Respect others' intellectual contributions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consider Artists and Creators">
    **Be thoughtful about:**
    - AI image generators trained on artists' work without permission
    - AI writing tools trained on authors' books
    - Musicians whose songs were used in training data

    **What you can do:**
    - Acknowledge that AI builds on others' creativity
    - Support original creators
    - Don't use AI to replicate specific artists' styles without credit
    - Be transparent about AI use in creative work
  </Step>
</Steps>

  **What you can do:**
  - Use AI thoughtfully, not frivolously
  - Ask focused questions instead of multiple vague ones
  - Consider if you really need AI for simple tasks
  - Balance AI benefits with environmental awareness
</Info>

### Societal Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Job Displacement" icon="briefcase">
    **The Reality:**
    AI is changing the job market. Some jobs may be automated, while new jobs are created.

    **Your Responsibility:**
    - Learn to work *with* AI, not just rely on it
    - Develop uniquely human skills (creativity, empathy, critical thinking)
    - Understand how AI affects different industries
    - Prepare for an AI-integrated future workplace

    **The Eagle Way:**
    Use AI to enhance your capabilities, not replace essential skills. Be prepared to adapt and continue learning.

    **Your Responsibility:**
    - Verify information from multiple sources
    - Don't spread AI-generated content without verification
    - Never create misleading or harmful deepfakes
    - Question suspicious media
    - Report misinformation

    **Critical Thinking:**
    Just because something *looks* or *sounds* real doesn't mean it is. Always verify.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Case Studies: Ethical Dilemmas

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Case 1: The Group Project" icon="users">
    **Scenario:**
    Your group is working on a presentation. One member suggests using AI to write the entire script, claiming "everyone does it" and it will save time.

    **Ethical Questions:**
    - Is this fair to other groups not using AI this way?
    - Will your group actually learn the material?
    - Does this violate the assignment requirements?
    - How should AI be disclosed if used?

    **Possible Approaches:**

    ✅ **Responsible:**
    - Check assignment guidelines about AI use
    - Ask the teacher for clarification
    - Use AI for brainstorming and outline only
    - Write the script yourselves, with AI for editing
    - Disclose AI use in your presentation

    ❌ **Irresponsible:**
    - Have AI write everything and submit it
    - Don't tell the teacher about AI use
    - Let other group members think you wrote it
    - Copy AI output without understanding it
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Case 2: The Emergency Situation" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Scenario:**
    It's 11 PM the night before your essay is due. You haven't started. You're exhausted and desperate. You think "just this once" about having AI write it.

    **Ethical Questions:**
    - Is time pressure a valid excuse for dishonesty?
    - What are the consequences if caught?
    - What would you actually learn?
    - How did you get into this situation?

    **Possible Approaches:**

    ✅ **Responsible:**
    - Email your teacher explaining the situation
    - Ask for an extension (accept the late penalty if necessary)
    - Use AI for outline and key points, write it yourself
    - Learn from this and manage time better next time
    - Submit what you can honestly complete

    ❌ **Irresponsible:**
    - Have AI write the whole essay
    - Submit AI work as yours
    - Justify it as "necessary"
    - Hope you don't get caught

    **Reflection:**
    Academic integrity matters even when it's hard. Short-term relief isn't worth long-term consequences.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Case 3: The Biased Output" icon="scale-unbalanced">
    **Scenario:**
    You ask AI to generate examples of successful leaders. It provides only examples of male Western leaders, with no women or people from Asia, Africa, or other regions.

    **Ethical Questions:**
    - Should you use these biased examples?
    - How does this affect your understanding?
    - What's your responsibility when you notice bias?
    - How can you get better information?

    **Possible Approaches:**

    ✅ **Responsible:**
    - Recognize the bias
    - Modify your prompt: "Give me diverse examples of successful leaders including women, people from Asia, Africa, and other regions"
    - Research beyond AI to find diverse examples
    - Discuss the bias with your class or teacher
    - Learn about bias in AI systems

    ❌ **Irresponsible:**
    - Use the biased examples without questioning
    - Assume AI output is always correct and complete
    - Perpetuate stereotypes in your work
    - Ignore the lack of diversity

    **Reflection:**
    When you notice bias, you have an opportunity to do better. Question AI outputs and seek diverse perspectives.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
