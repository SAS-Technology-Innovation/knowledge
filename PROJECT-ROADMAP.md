## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Theme Choice:** Palm selected for enterprise/educational focus with structured hierarchies
- **Navigation:** Division tabs in header for prominence, guides in sidebar for organization
- **Footer:** 5 columns for comprehensive info (Tech Support, Divisions, Quick Links, About, Contact)

### Content Strategy
- Document just enough for user success
- Prioritize accuracy and usability
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Avoid duplication unless strategic
- Write for SAS community: parents, students, faculty, staff
- Include "The Eagle Way" ethos when appropriate

### Technical Constraints
- Mintlify Palm theme requires `items` (not `links`) for footer columns
- Footer links require `href` (not `url`) property
- All footer hrefs must be valid full URLs (relative paths like "/" not accepted)
